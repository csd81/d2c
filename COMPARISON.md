# Paper vs. Implementation: `2604.14228v1` ("Dive into Claude Code") vs. `d2c`

This document compares the architecture described in the paper *"Dive into Claude Code: The
Design Space of Today's and Future AI Agent Systems"* (`2604.14228v1.pdf`) against the actual
Python implementation in this repository (`src/d2c/`).

The comparison was produced by reading the full 46-page paper and a source-level inventory of the
implementation (~51 files, ~11,200 LOC).

## What each one is

| | Paper — "Dive into Claude Code" | `d2c` |
|---|---|---|
| Subject | Source-level analysis of **Claude Code** (TypeScript, v2.1.88) | A **Python reimplementation** built *from* the paper |
| Size | ~1,884 files, ~512K LOC | ~51 files, ~11,200 LOC |
| Model backend | Claude (Anthropic) | **DeepSeek** via the Anthropic-compatible SDK |
| Relationship | Describes the design space | Reproduces the essential subsystems phase-by-phase |

`d2c`'s source comments reference "the paper" with section numbers throughout — it is deliberately an
educational port. The useful question is therefore **fidelity**: what it reproduces faithfully, what
it scales down, and what is scaffolded but inert.

**Overall verdict:** the architectural skeleton is faithful; roughly a dozen features are present as
code but not wired into the running loop, plus two genuine correctness bugs.

---

## 1. Faithfully reproduced

Structure and behavior match the paper closely, often down to function names.

- **Agent loop (§4).** `queryLoop()` is a single async generator with a mutable `LoopState`,
  matching the paper's "while-true with whole-object state" (§4.1). Tool partitioning matches §4.2:
  consecutive `is_concurrent_safe` tools batch and run concurrently via `asyncio`, results emit in
  original order, and a **sibling-abort signal** fires when a Bash tool errors (the paper's
  `StreamingToolExecutor`). Mid-response streaming execution is implemented
  (`streaming_executor.py`).
- **Compaction pipeline (§4.3 / §7.3).** The strongest match. The paper's **five sequential
  shapers** — budget reduction → snip → microcompact → context collapse → auto-compact — are all
  present in `compact.py` with the same names, ordering, and "cheaper layers first" gating.
  Cache-aligned boundaries (§7.3) are implemented as `_find_cache_alignment_point` on 1024-token
  multiples.
- **Permissions (§5).** Deny-first evaluation (all DENY before any ALLOW) matches §5.1. The
  **AST-based shell classifier** (`permissions/classifier.py`, ~656 lines) genuinely implements the
  paper's `bashSecurity.ts`: logical-statement splitting, wrapper stripping (`sudo`/`env`/`nohup`),
  pipe-to-interpreter and SSRF detection, with a two-stage fast-filter → CoT-model design mirroring
  the auto-mode classifier (§5.3).
- **Context assembly (§7.1).** `getSystemContext()` is memoized, git status is cached, and CLAUDE.md
  is placed as the **first user message, not system prompt** — the exact structural choice the paper
  calls out (§7.1–7.2).
- **Memory (§7.2).** Four-level hierarchy, root→cwd traversal with "later = higher priority,"
  `@include` with code-fence skipping and circular-reference guarding.
- **Persistence (§9).** Append-only JSONL transcripts, `compact_boundary` markers that reset the
  message list on replay, resume/fork, sidechain subdirectories, and — importantly — **permissions
  are NOT restored on resume/fork** (§9.2).
- **MCP (§6), tiktoken (§7), worktree isolation (§8), trust gate.** All substantively real: a full
  JSON-RPC client *and* a `--mcp` server, all four transports (stdio/http/sse/ws), real
  `cl100k_base` tokenization, real `git worktree` isolation, and a persistent trust store gating
  project-local `.env` / CLAUDE.md / MCP / skills / plugins.

---

## 2. Scaled down (present, but smaller than the paper)

| Subsystem | Paper | `d2c` |
|---|---|---|
| **Tool count** (§6.2, App. A) | up to **54** (19 unconditional + 35 gated) | **29** built-ins + dynamic MCP (Phase 63 added ReadRange for line-range reads; see `plans/tool-inventory.md`) |
| **Permission modes** (§5.1) | **7** (plan, default, acceptEdits, auto, dontAsk, bypassPermissions, bubble) | **6** — has AUTO + BYPASS, **no `bubble`** (subagent-escalation mode) |
| **Hook events** (§6.1) | **27** defined, 5 in permission flow | **27 defined** (matches), but only **12 actually fired** |
| **Subagent types** (§8) | up to 6 (Explore, Plan, general, Guide, Verification, Statusline) | 3 built-in (Explore, Plan, general-purpose) + user-defined YAML capability profiles (Phase 61: model/mode/tool-boundaries/isolation, trust-gated) |
| **Bundled skills/plugins** | skill + command + plugin registries | **1 skill** (`commit.md`), **0 bundled plugins** |
| **Permission handler paths** (§5.2) | coordinator / swarm / speculative / interactive | interactive + async classifier only |

These are reasonable scope cuts for a teaching implementation and don't contradict the paper's
design.

## 3. Gaps and bugs (scaffolded but inert, or behaviorally wrong)

> **Status update:** The gaps below describe the pre-Phase-34 state. **Phases 34–40 resolved most of
> them** (see the `plans/phase34`…`phase40` docs). Resolved items are marked ✅ inline.

Several features exist as complete-looking modules but are **never wired into the loop**, so at
runtime they do nothing. Two are outright correctness bugs.

1. **Read-before-Write safety check is broken.** ✅ *Fixed in Phase 34; regression-tested in Phase 37.*
   `FileReadTool` now marks files read (in the tool, so it holds on both the streaming and
   non-streaming paths); Edit and Write both enforce it. Covered by `tests/test_phase34.py` and
   `tests/test_phase37.py` (Edit-without-Read blocked, Read-then-Edit succeeds).
2. **Output-token recovery (§4.4) is absent.** ✅ *Fixed in Phase 35.* The paper describes escalating
   retries (`MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS_RECOVERY_LIMIT = 3`). `d2c` previously had the
   `output_tokens_recovery_attempts` field but never read it; `max_tokens` was hardcoded to 8192.
   Now `queryLoop` escalates `max_tokens` (8192 → 16384 → 32768, capped) and retries up to 3× on a
   `max_tokens` stop, resetting after any clean response; covered by `tests/test_loop_output_recovery.py`.
3. **Reactive vs. proactive compaction share one flag.** ✅ *Fixed in Phase 34.* Proactive
   `autoCompact` now uses `has_attempted_proactive_compact`, independent of the reactive
   `prompt_too_long` path. (The reactive path still does a crude slice truncation rather than a full
   summary — an intentional simplification, not a blocker.)
4. **Sandbox (§5.4) is implemented but never attached.** ✅ *Wired in Phase 34; tested in Phase 37;
   OS-level backend added in Phase 62.* `SandboxConfig` flows through the pool into `BashTool`
   (`D2C_SANDBOX=1`, off by default); the process backend is reachable and exercised on POSIX and
   Windows, and Phase 62 adds a real Linux **bubblewrap** OS-level backend
   (`D2C_SANDBOX_BACKEND=bubblewrap`) with rw-cwd / ro-system-roots / unshared-network / fail-closed
   semantics, verified by live confinement tests. Covered by `tests/test_sandbox.py`,
   `tests/test_phase37.py`, and `tests/test_phase62_sandbox.py`. *The Windows-sandbox backend remains
   an explicit stub* (falls back to the process backend).
5. **File-history checkpoints / `--rewind-files` (§9) don't work.** ✅ *Fixed in Phase 34; tested in
   Phase 37.* The tracker is installed at startup (headless + interactive) and re-pointed on session
   switch (`/clear`, `/resume`, `/fork`). Write/Edit checkpoint before mutating; `--rewind-files`
   restores. Covered by `tests/test_phase34.py` (checkpoint + rewind end-to-end) and
   `tests/test_phase37.py` (tracker re-points on `/clear`).
6. **KAIROS (§11.6) is completely un-instantiated** — dead code (the paper also flags it as
   feature-gated / unconfirmed-in-production, so this is a fair reflection). *Still unresolved (out of
   scope).*
7. **Other implemented-but-unwired modules.** ✅ *Mostly wired in Phase 34.* `AutoMemoryStore` is now
   reachable via the `Remember` tool with the `MEMORY.md` index injected into context;
   `PathScopedRules` are consulted by `PermissionEngine.evaluate` (Phase 34/37); the
   background-subagent manager is exposed via the `AgentStatus` tool. (`applyFullContextShapers`
   remains an unused duplicate of the loop's inlined shaper pipeline — harmless dead code.)
8. **~15 hook events defined but never fired.** ✅ *Fixed across Phases 34 & 40.* **19 of the 27**
   `HookEvent`s now fire from tested runtime paths (session/prompt/tool/compaction/subagent/task
   lifecycle, plus `FILE_CHANGED` on Write/Edit/NotebookEdit and `INSTRUCTIONS_LOADED` at session
   start; `/clear`/`/resume`/`/fork` fire `SESSION_END`+`SESSION_START`). The remaining **8** are
   **intentionally inactive** — they have no runtime source in a single-user CLI (`CWD_CHANGED`,
   `CONFIG_CHANGE` — cwd/config are immutable after load; `ELICITATION`/`ELICITATION_RESULT`,
   `NOTIFICATION`, `PERMISSION_REQUEST`, `STOP_FAILURE`, `TEAMMATE_IDLE`). A categorization test
   (`tests/test_phase40_hooks.py`) asserts every event is either fired or documented-inactive, and
   observability-hook failures are isolated from the tool path.
9. **WebSearch is a stub** (returns "not configured"). ✅ *Fixed in Phase 39.* Now a real
   provider-backed tool (`SearchProvider` abstraction + a Tavily provider) reading
   `D2C_WEBSEARCH_PROVIDER`/`D2C_WEBSEARCH_API_KEY` from the environment; returns normalized
   title/URL/snippet results with clean auth/rate-limit/timeout/empty handling and no key leakage.
   Unconfigured still returns a clear error. Covered by `tests/test_web_search.py` (mocked network)
   and live-tested end-to-end against Tavily with basic search, domain filtering, structured
   metadata, and bad-key auth handling. SearXNG remains a future optional provider, not implemented
   yet.
10. **REPL slash commands are cosmetic.** ✅ *Fixed in Phases 34/36.* `/help`, `/settings`, `/clear`,
    `/resume`, `/fork` are real (and the REPL is now multi-turn); unknown `/x` is reported locally and
    never sent to the model. Covered by `tests/test_repl_commands.py`.
11. **`_check_safe_shell` auto-allows `rm`, `mv`, `sed`** under `acceptEdits` via first-word-only
    matching. ✅ *Fixed in Phase 38.* Replaced with structural classification
    (`classify_accept_edits_shell`): only read-only / create-only / test-lint-format commands are
    auto-approved; `rm`, `mv`, `sed -i`, `find -delete`, pipe-to-shell, interpreter `-c`, `chmod`,
    `sudo`, … are **denied**; uncertain commands ask. Covered by `tests/test_phase38.py` and the
    `acceptEdits` cases in `tests/test_permissions.py`.
12. **Fail-open permission gate.** ✅ *Fixed in Phase 38.* Both the non-streaming (`_execute_one_tool`)
    and streaming (`StreamingToolExecutor`) paths previously treated a permission-evaluation exception
    as *allow*. They now **fail closed** — a permission error returns a denial and the tool never
    executes (verified with a side-effect tool in `tests/test_phase38.py`; the denial does not leak
    the exception message).

---

## 4. Design-choice divergences (not bugs)

- **Backend:** DeepSeek, not Claude. Config, model aliases (`v4-pro` / `chat` / `reasoner`), and
  128K context windows are DeepSeek-specific — the paper is entirely about Claude (200K–1M windows).
- **Pre-trust ordering CVEs (§11.3):** the paper documents CVE-2025-59536 etc., caused by extension
  code running before the trust dialog. `d2c` resolves trust *before* `Config.load` / plugin load,
  so it structurally avoids that specific temporal gap.
- ~~**Fail-open permission:** if `evaluate_async` throws, the tool is treated as *allowed*.~~
  ✅ *Fixed in Phase 38 — the permission gate now fails closed in both executor paths.*

---

## 5. Bottom line

`d2c` is a **high-fidelity structural port of the paper's architecture**. The agent loop, the
five-layer compaction pipeline, deny-first permissions with an AST shell classifier, MCP
client+server, worktree isolation, tiktoken accounting, and append-only persistence all match the
described designs closely, often down to function names.

Most of the original "last-mile wiring" gaps and both correctness bugs were **closed in Phases
34–43** (Read-before-Write, file-history/rewind, sandbox, path rules, hook firing, auto-memory,
background-status, output-token recovery, compaction-flag split, real slash commands, shell
permission hardening, Tavily-backed WebSearch, +6 built-in tools, and interactive ASK handling) —
each now covered by tests, with WebSearch also live-verified against the real Tavily API. What
remains diverging is mostly **breadth** (28 tools vs 54) and a few **deliberately out-of-scope**
items.

**Interactive ASK (Phases 43 & 49).** `ASK` no longer falls through to automatic execution anywhere:
a shared `resolve_permission_decision` gates both executors and the MCP path. The REPL prompts the
user (`[y/N]`, default deny); headless / MCP / no-callback contexts return a clear
permission-required denial. Phase 49 adds granular, correlated audit events
(`permission_ask`/`approved`/`denied`/`required`/`approval_error`, no secrets). Verified with
side-effect tools in `tests/test_phase43_ask_permissions.py` and `tests/test_phase49_ask_permissions.py`.

**Observability (Phase 44).** Addresses the paper's silent-failure / observability–evaluation gap
(§11.6, §12.1): opt-in structured JSONL audit logging (`observability.py`) with central redaction and
`session_id`/`turn_id`/`tool_call_id` correlation across session, model-call, tool-call, permission,
file-change, compaction, hook-failure, and WebSearch events. Full prompts/tool-outputs are off by
default. Covered by `tests/test_observability.py`.

### Still open (intentionally deferred)

1. **KAIROS** background heartbeat mode — un-instantiated (paper flags it as unconfirmed too).
2. **Windows sandbox backend** — explicit stub (falls back to the process backend).
3. 8 lifecycle hooks are **intentionally inactive** (no runtime source in a single-user CLI:
   `CWD_CHANGED`, `CONFIG_CHANGE`, elicitation, `NOTIFICATION`, `PERMISSION_REQUEST`, `STOP_FAILURE`,
   `TEAMMATE_IDLE`) — documented and asserted, not broken.
4. **Persistent "always allow"** approvals and a full TUI permission dialog — Phase 43 does one-shot
   approval only; caching approvals is a later phase.
